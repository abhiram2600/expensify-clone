# Expensify app clone

This is my attempt to clone the expensify app.

Tech stack used - Expo, React Navigation, Zustand

## Current status of the development

Auth screens work with dummy data (Valid email check and 6 digit PIN)

Search screen shows dummy data with the ability to update values.

In settings screen, clicking on preferences will toggle the color mode and sign out button logs out.

Pressing on the plus button in navbar opens a modal but it has dummy button. Functionality still needs to be implemented.

Inbox and chat features are yet to be implemented.

## Installation instructions

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
